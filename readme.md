# Row copy

Performs deep row copying from one database to another. Including all rows from child and parent tables.

## Purpose

Ever needed to test something locally on a staging/uat/prod data? You only need a couple of entities, but the tables are
intertwined with all the relationships, so you spend an hour copying all the required data from a dozen different tables
just to have that two rows that you're interested in. Then next day you need to do the same, but with a different rows.
And you've shut down your postgres container, so the database is clean and you need to start from scratch.

Enters `rowcp`. Rowcp has a very limited purpose - copy a couple of rows from the table in one database into a different
database while satisfying all the dependencies. All the rows from the tables that your table has a foreign key to, and
all the rows they have a foreign key to and all rows from the tables that have a foreign key pointing to these tow rows
that you're copying and so on.

## Usage

TBD

## Limitations

Rowcp is intended to help with testing, not to copy databases. It is assumed that target database is empty or almost
empty and there would be no conflicts in the data. Rowcp does not try to clean up target tables or update existing data,
if there is a duplicate key situation, then copying **will** fail.

Autogenerated fields in target database are not supported. All the autoincremented fields will be inserted as they are
in the source database
